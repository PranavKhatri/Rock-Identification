# Rock-Identification
CNN 

Deep learning is receiving significant research attention for pattern recognition and machine learning. Its application here has effectively identified rock types from images captured in the field. This paper proposes an accurate approach for identifying rock types in the field based on image analysis using deep convolutional neural networks. The results show that the proposed approach based on deep learning represents an improvement in intelligent rock-type identification and solves several difficulties facing the automated identification of rock types in the field.Who are experienced in the field of geological they can identify the rocks easily. But who are new to the field, it can help to identify the type of rock.
